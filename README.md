# Blood Test Analysis and Health Recommendations System
Overview üìù
This project automates the analysis of blood test reports, searches for relevant health articles, and provides health recommendations. It uses multiple agents to extract text from PDFs, find relevant articles, and deliver health advice based on findings. The project is powered by Python, Conda, Streamlit, Langchain, and Google Generative AI.

# Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è
Blood Test Analysis:

1. Extracts text from PDF blood test reports using PyPDF2.
Summarizes findings with the Google Generative AI model (gemini-1.5-flash).
Health Article Search:

2. Uses the SerperDevTool to search the internet for health-related articles based on blood test results.

3. Retrieves reliable information from trusted sources.Health Recommendations:

4. AI analyzes collected health articles to provide personalized health recommendations.
Email Delivery:

5. Sends an email containing the blood test summary, article links, and health recommendations using the Flask API and yagmail.
